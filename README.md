# SDL2---Testing-Game
This is a small project with intention to study and learn about SDL2 api, making a simple game that i will be changing stuff in future. 
The objective about this program is increment the C language to make a simple game, Im new on all that so may my commits wont be so precise. Also is a way to keep saving my project in somewhere.
